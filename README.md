# Standard-ML-Projects

These projects are from a comparative survey course in programming language paradigms; studying the applications, syntax, and semantics of imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming languages.

These project files are .sml and can be opened in a text editor.

To run swipl programs use the .swiple command in terminal.
